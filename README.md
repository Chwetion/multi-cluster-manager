## Introduction

With the migration of core business to Kubernetes, a single Kubernetes cluster may no longer be able to meet many scenarios, such as two locations and three centers, dual-active, and disaster recovery.

In addition, load balancing, network policy, and scheduling between multiple clusters also need to be resolved.

We hope to solve these problems using Multi-Cluster-Manager (MCM).
